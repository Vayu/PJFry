Installing libpjfry version 1.0.0
=================================

On Unix/Linux and similar systems, execute the following commands:
./configure [--prefix=/path] \
    [--with-mcc-path=/path/mcc] \
    [--with-integrals=auto,qcdloop,oneloop] \
    [LDFLAGS=linker flags] \
    [CXXFLAGS=c++ flags]
make
make install

If --prefix is not specified, the library will be installed
to the system default library path (usually /usr/local/lib).

If --with-mcc option is not specified, configure script will try to find Mathematica
installation in system PATH and a few common locations.
You can override this behaviour by setting --with-mcc-path=no
or give full path to the appropriate mcc tool --with-mcc-path=/path/mcc

If --with-integrals option is not specified, configure script will try to find
any usable scalar integrals library from the supported list:
QCDLoop (libqcdloop.a and libff.a) or OneLOoop (libavh_olo.a)

You can select which library to use by --with-integral=oneloop or --with-integral=qcdloop
And tell configure where to look for it by setting LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/scalar/integral/library'
(additional linking flags like '-lgfortran' should be also added to LDFLAGS)


MathLink interface
==================
MathLink interface consists of single executable, which will be installed to
 $prefix/bin/PJFry

Use the following command to run it inside Mathematica:
 Install["path/bin/PJFry"]

NOTE if dynamic linking was chosen by configure script, the libpjfry.so
should be in system library search path or in LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable


Running FORTRAN examples
=====================================

Use 'make check' to compile a few simple examples of library use in FORTRAN
(also see note for g77 users)


REMARK for g77 users
====================

Current FORTRAN interface follows GNU calling conventions for COMPLEX type.

To work with g77 this library needs to be compiled with FFLAGS='-fno-f2c'
(also library for scalar integrals).

Alternatively you can replace FORTRAN wrapper functions in pjfry.h and pjfry.cpp with subroutines.
e.g. "pj_complex pa0_(double *m1, int *ep)" -> "void pa0_(pj_complex *rslt, double *m1, int *ep)"

// FFLAGS='-fno-f2c'
pj_complex pa0_( double *m1, int *ep) {
  return PJFry::A0v0(*m1,*ep);
}

// FFLAGS='-ff2c'
void pa0_( pj_complex *rslt, double *m1, int *ep) {
  *rslt=PJFry::A0v0(*m1,*ep);
  return;
}
